# Decision Log

Architectural and design decisions for the Steel Compendium v2 site.

## Why Log Decisions

- Context doesn't survive in memory. Recording why a choice was made prevents relitigating it later.
- Small decisions compound. A record of what worked (and what didn't) builds a navigable history of the project's evolution.

## What to Log

Every decision, regardless of size:
- Library and plugin choices
- Content structure changes
- UI/UX approaches tried and abandoned
- Link format and build pipeline decisions
- Convention choices
- Reverted experiments

## How to Create a Record

1. Copy the template below into a new file
2. Name it `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`
3. Fill in all sections
4. Set the status

## Filename Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md` -- files sort chronologically. Multiple decisions on the same date are fine.

## Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `proposed` | Under consideration, not yet implemented |
| `accepted` | Chosen and implemented |
| `tried` | Implemented but didn't work out |
| `superseded` | Replaced by a later decision |
| `deprecated` | Being phased out |

## Template

```markdown
# Title

**Status:** proposed | accepted | tried | superseded | deprecated
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

Why was this decision needed?

## Options Considered

### Option A
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...

### Option B
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...

## Decision

What was chosen and why.

## Consequences

- Positive outcomes
- Accepted tradeoffs

## Outcome

Leave blank if recent. Fill in once there's real experience to report.
```
