        **Poison Darts (+2 EV)** The darts are tipped with poison. Any creature who takes damage from a dart also takes 1d6 poison damage at the start of each of their turns (save ends).

        **Large Darts (+1 EV)** Larger, heavier darts impart kinetic force to the trap's attack. A target of the **Dart** ability is pushed 1 square on a tier 1 outcome, 2 squares on a tier 2 outcome, or 3 squares on a tier 3 outcome.

        **Gatling Darts (+4 EV)** The dart trap is equipped with multiple barrels to launch darts at a high rate of fire. The **Dart** ability loses the Ranged and Strike and takes the Area keyword, its area becomes a 5 x 1 line within 1, and it deals an extra 1d6 damage.
