#### Tactician Abilities

You are a formidable combatant in your own right, but your greatest strength is the abilities you wield that let you shape control of the battlefield.

##### Kit Signature Ability

Each kit from your [Field Arsenal](../../../../../Browse/Features/Tactician/1st-Level%20Features/Field%20Arsenal) feature grants you a signature ability. Signature abilities can be used at will.
