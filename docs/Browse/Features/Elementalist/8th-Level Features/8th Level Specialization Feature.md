#### 8th-Level Specialization Feature

Your [elemental specialization](../../../../Browse/Features/Elementalist/1st-Level Features/Elemental Specialization.md#elemental-specialization) grants you a feature, as shown on the 8th-Level [Elemental Specialization](../../../../Browse/Features/Elementalist/1st-Level Features/Elemental Specialization.md#elemental-specialization) Features table.

##### Black Hole Star

You warp gravity around your heavenly body and can pull even the sturdiest titans toward your core. At the end of each of your turns, you target one creature or object within distance of your [Hurl Element](../../../../Browse/Features/Elementalist/1st-Level Features/Hurl Element.md#hurl-element) ability and [vertical](../../../../Browse/Movement/Vertical.md#vertical) pull that target up to 5 squares. If their [stability](../../../../Browse/Movement/Stability.md#stability) reduces this forced movement, they are pulled a minimum of 2 squares. This forced movement ignores [stability](../../../../Browse/Movement/Stability.md#stability) for your allies.

Additionally, your [Mantle of Essence](../../../../Browse/Features/Elementalist/4th-Level Features/Mantle of Essence.md#mantle-of-essence) improves. While in the area of the aura, enemies and objects have their [stability](../../../../Browse/Movement/Stability.md#stability) reduced by an amount equal to your level.

##### Chimeric Manifestation

Nature isn't static and unchanging, and neither are you. You can enter or exit your animal form as a free maneuver the first time you use your [Disciple of the Green](../../../../Browse/Features/Elementalist/2nd-Level Features/2nd-Level Specialization Feature/Disciple of the Green.md#disciple-of-the-green) feature on your turn.

Additionally, whenever you use your [Disciple of the Green](../../../../Browse/Features/Elementalist/2nd-Level Features/2nd-Level Specialization Feature/Disciple of the Green.md#disciple-of-the-green) feature, you can select an additional animal form and gain the positive benefits from both forms. You can choose the size of either animal, and if both animal forms grant you the same benefit, you can choose whichever you prefer. You gain the highest speed between the two animal forms and have all types of movement from both forms.

You can only combine animal forms whose levels add up to 12 or less. For example, you can combine a shark (8th level) with a horse (4th level), but you can't combine a shark with a bear (5th level).

##### The Flame Primordial

You produce a fire that entrances the fates, distracting them from aiding your foes. Whenever you deal fire damage to a creature or object, they take an extra 1d6 fire damage. If you deal fire damage to a mundane object, you can use a free triggered action to target it with your [Return to Formlessness](../../../../Browse/Features/Elementalist/1st-Level Features/1st-Level Specialization Feature/Return to Formlessness.md#return-to-formlessness) ability instead.

Additionally, any enemy who starts their turn adjacent to you has fire weakness equal to your Reason score until the start of their next turn. This increases to twice your Reason score if the enemy is made of or is wearing mostly metal.

##### Summon Source of Earth

You have the following ability.
