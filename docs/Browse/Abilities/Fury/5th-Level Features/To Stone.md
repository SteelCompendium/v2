###### To Stone! (9 Ferocity)

*You channel the Primordial Chaos into blows that petrify your foe... literally.*

| **Magic, Melee, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                   | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** 9 + M damage; M < WEAK, [slowed](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Slowed) (save ends)
- **12-16:** 13 + M damage; M < AVERAGE, [slowed](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Slowed) (save ends)
- **17+:** 18 + M damage; M < STRONG, [restrained](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Restrained) (save ends)

**Effect:** While the target is [slowed](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Slowed) this way, any other effect that would make the target [slowed](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Slowed) instead makes them [restrained](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Restrained) by this ability. Additionally, a creature who fails the saving throw while [restrained](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Restrained) this way is petrified until they are given a supernatural cure or you choose to reverse the effect (no action required).
