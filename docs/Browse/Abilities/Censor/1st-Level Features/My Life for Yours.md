###### My Life for Yours

*You channel some of your vitality into more resilience for you or an ally.*

| **Magic, Ranged** |           **Triggered** |
| ----------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Trigger:** The target starts their turn or takes damage.

**Effect:** You spend a Recovery and the target regains Stamina equal to your recovery value.

**Spend 1 Wrath:** You can end one effect on the target that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of their turn, or a [prone](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Prone) target can stand up.
