###### Iron Grip (9 Discipline)

*You grab the target with supernatural force.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                     | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **≤11:** 10 + A damage; A < WEAK, [grabbed](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Grabbed)
- **12-16:** 14 + A damage; A < AVERAGE, [grabbed](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Grabbed)
- **17+:** 18 + A damage; A < STRONG, [grabbed](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Grabbed)

**Effect:** While [grabbed](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Grabbed) this way, the target takes a bane on the [Escape Grab](../../../../../Browse/Abilities/Common/Maneuvers/Escape%20Grab) maneuver. Each time they use that maneuver, they take damage equal to twice your Agility score.
