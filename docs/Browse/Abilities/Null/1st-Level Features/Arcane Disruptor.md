###### Arcane Disruptor (5 Discipline)

*Your blow reorders a foe's body, causing pain if they attempt to channel sorcery.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                     | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **≤11:** 8 + **A** psychic damage; M < WEAK, [weakened](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Weakened) (save ends)
- **12-16:** 12 + **A** psychic damage; M < AVERAGE, [weakened](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Weakened) (save ends)
- **17+:** 16 + **A** psychic damage; M < STRONG, [weakened](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Weakened) (save ends)

**Effect:** While [weakened](../../../../../Browse/Conditions/Weakened) this way, the target takes damage equal to your Intuition score whenever they use a supernatural ability that costs Malice.
